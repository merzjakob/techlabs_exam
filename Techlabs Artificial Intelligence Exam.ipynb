    "At the first day, your boss comes to you and asks you, whether he should buy a _call option_* with a certain set of characteristics for 1€.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *A call option gives you the right (but not obligation) to buy a share for a certain strike price. In other words, if the stock price is higher than the strike price, you get the difference, otherwise, you get 0: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    callpayoff = max(stockprice - strikeprice, 0) \n",
    "\n",
    "To price the option, you shall build a monte-carlo simulator which generatates _1 000 000_ random walks, each representing the stock price in one year, which is when the option can be expired. By taking the average of these payouts, you will get the expected payout at expiry!\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, your boss has also given you the characteristics and hints for how the stock price moves: \n",
    "\n",
    "The stock price follows a student T distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (the rvs function within the t class from scipy.stats package is a great tool for creating random walks with this distribution: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.t.html  ctrl+f \"rvs\") \n",
    "\n",
    "- The stock price today: 69\n",
    "- Stock returns follow student T distribution with 3 degrees of freedom\n",
    "- drift of 10% per year \n",
    "- volatility of 20%\n",
    "- strike price of the option is 96\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build a function that returns the price of the call option, and shows your boss what payout he can expect from the option in order to explain him, whether he should buy it or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    P.S.: If you run into trouble on your way, you can always ask for tips from your boss and since he is a nice guy, he will also give a good grade for all attempts!"
